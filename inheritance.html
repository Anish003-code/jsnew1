/*                                                  inheritance
In programming, inheritance refers to passing down characteristics from a parent to a child so that a new piece of code can reuse and 
build upon the features of an existing one. JavaScript implements inheritance by using objects. Each object has an internal link to another 
object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype
. By definition, null has no prototype and acts as the final link in this prototype chain. 
It is possible to mutate any member of the prototype chain or even swap out the prototype at runtime

  1. class keyword: Used to define both parent and child classes.
  2. extends keyword: Indicates that ChildClass inherits from ParentClass.

  class ParentClass {
  constructor(property) {
    this.property = property;
  }

  method() {
    console.log("This is a method in the parent class.");
  }
}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
  constructor(property, childProperty) {
    super(property); // Call the parent class constructor
    this.childProperty = childProperty;
  }

    console.log("This is a method in the child class.");
