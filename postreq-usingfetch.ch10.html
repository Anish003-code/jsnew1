        /*
        A POST request with fetch is used to send data from the client to a server. This is common when you want to submit form data, 
        create new resources, or send information that the server will process in some way.
Here's a breakdown of how a POST request works with fetch:
1.Setup: In a POST request, you define the URL, specify the HTTP method as POST, and include any data you want 
to send in the body of the request. This data is typically in JSON format and can include things like form inputs, JSON objects, or other data.
2.Headers: You usually set headers, especially Content-Type, to tell the server what kind of data you’re sending. When sending JSON data,
 set Content-Type to "application/json".
3. Response Handling: Just like with GET requests, fetch returns a promise. You can use .then() to handle the server’s response.

Key Parts Explained:=

URL: The endpoint where you’re sending the request.
Method: Set to "POST" for posting data.
Headers: "Content-Type": "application/json" indicates you’re sending JSON data.
Body: Use JSON.stringify(data) to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string. This is necessary because the fetch API expects a string 
for the request body.

Workflow of the POST Request=>

The client sends data to the server.
The server receives and processes the data (e.g., saving it to a database).
The server often sends a response back, which you can handle in the .then() chain.
Using fetch for POST requests makes it easy to send data to an API, handle responses, and perform error handling.
