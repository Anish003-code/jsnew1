console.log(document.cookie)

 document.cookie = "name = anishkumr" //  now this will update the value of the name cookie and the updated value of the name is anishkumr

 /*
 In JavaScript, encodeURIComponent() is a function that encodes a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) component by replacing each instance of
 certain characters with one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character. This is useful for
  encoding individual parts of a URI, such as query parameters, rather than the entire URI.

Key Points

encodeURIComponent() escapes all characters that have a special meaning in URIs, including &, =, ?, /, #, and :, by replacing them with their
 corresponding UTF-8 encoded representations (e.g., %20 for a space).
This function is commonly used to encode query string parameters to ensure they’re interpreted correctly by the server, even if they contain
 special characters.
Example

javascript
Copy code
let queryParam = "hello world&name=John Doe";
let encodedParam = encodeURIComponent(queryParam);

console.log(encodedParam);  // Output: "hello%20world%26name%3DJohn%20Doe"
Use Case
When sending data in URLs, encodeURIComponent() ensures that special characters (like &, =, and spaces) don’t interfere with the 
structure of the URL and are transmitted correctly.

Common Use with URLs
javascript
Copy code
let baseUrl = "https://example.com/search";
let query = "JavaScript & React";
let fullUrl = `${baseUrl}?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`;

console.log(fullUrl);  
// Output: "https://example.com/search?q=JavaScript%20%26%20React"
In this example, the special characters (& and space) are safely encoded, so the URL will work as expected.

to decode it we use decodeURIcomponent(encoded value)
 

 let a = "my aname is anish and my password is abc"
 let codeda  = encodeURIComponent(a);
 console.log(codeda)
 console.log(decodeURIComponent(codeda))
