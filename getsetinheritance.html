        /*                                          getter and setters 
 In JavaScript, getters and setters are special methods that allow you to define how properties of an object are accessed and 
 modified. They are commonly used to add additional logic when retrieving or updating an object's properties.

What is a Getter?
A getter is a method that gets the value of a property. It allows you to define a custom way of returning a property's value while
 keeping it accessible like a normal property.
Syntax:
get propertyName() {
  // Logic to return the value
}

Example:
javascript
Copy code
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }

  // Getter for fullName
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
}

const person = new Person("John", "Doe");
console.log(person.fullName); // "John Doe"
                                            EXPNATION TO THE CODE 
 
class Person {
This defines a new class called Person.
Classes in JavaScript are templates for creating objects and allow encapsulation of data and behavior.
Constructor
javascript
Copy code
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
The constructor method is a special function that is automatically called when a new instance of the Person class is created.
Parameters:
firstName: Represents the first name of the person.
lastName:  Represents the last name of the person.
Assignments:-
this.firstName assigns the value of the firstName parameter to the instance property firstName.
this.lastName assigns the value of the lastName parameter to the instance property lastName.
Getter for fullName
javascript
Copy code
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
This defines a getter named fullName.
Purpose:
The getter allows the fullName property to be accessed like a normal property (e.g., person.fullName), even though it executes a function.

++=>                                   
                                             explanation to this line 
                                             
In JavaScript, when you use a getter, it makes a function look like a regular property. This means you don’t need to call it with parentheses 
like a normal function.
Without a Getter
Let’s say you want to get a person’s full name from their first and last names. Normally, you would write a method like this:
code=> 
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }

  // Regular method
  getFullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
}

const person = new Person("John", "Doe");
console.log(person.getFullName()); // "John Doe" (requires parentheses)
Here, you have to call getFullName() using parentheses () to get the full name.

With a Getter
With a getter, you don’t need parentheses. You can simply access it like a property, even though it’s still running a function in the 
background.

javascript
Copy code
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }

  // Getter
  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  } 
}

const person = new Person("John", "Doe");
console.log(person.fullName); // "John Doe" (no parentheses needed)
Q. Why This is Useful
soln-> Looks Cleaner: Instead of calling a method like person.getFullName(), you can simply write person.fullName. It feels like you’re 
accessing a property, even though some logic is being executed.
Encapsulation: The logic for computing fullName is hidden from the user. They just see it as a property

<=++
Logic:
It returns a string template (${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}) that combines the firstName and lastName properties with a space in between.
Creating an Instance
javascript
Copy code
const person = new Person("John", "Doe");
What happens here?
The new Person("John", "Doe") creates a new instance of the Person class.
The constructor is called, with "John" passed as firstName and "Doe" passed as lastName.
The firstName and lastName properties are initialized with these values in the new person object.

What is a Setter?
A setter is a method that sets the value of a property. It allows you to define custom logic when a property is updated, 
such as validation or updating related values.

Syntax:
javascript
Copy code
set propertyName(value) {
  // Logic to set the value
}
Example:
javascript
Copy code
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }

  // Setter for fullName
  set fullName(name) {
    const parts = name.split(" ");
    this.firstName = parts[0];
    this.lastName = parts[1];
  }
}

const person = new Person("John", "Doe");
person.fullName = "Jane Smith"; // Invokes the setter
console.log(person.firstName); // "Jane"
console.log(person.lastName);  // "Smith"
Benefits of Getters and Setters
Encapsulation: Control how data is accessed or modified without exposing the internal implementation.
Validation: Add checks or validation when setting a value.
Computed Properties: Calculate values dynamically when accessing or updating properties.
