        classes 
Class Declaration: Classes are declared using the "class" keyword.
Example:
       class Person {
  name;

  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  introduceSelf() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}`);
  }
}
Components of the Class:
Property Declaration: The name property represents an attribute of the class.
Constructor Method: A special method, constructor, initializes new instances of the class with specific values (e.g., setting the name).
Instance Method: introduceSelf() is a method that uses this to access and manipulate the instanceâ€™s properties.
Property Declaration Details:

Explicitly declaring properties (e.g., name;) is optional.
If omitted, the this.name = name; line in the constructor will automatically create the property and assign its value.
Declaring properties explicitly in the class can improve code readability by clearly listing all attributes associated with the class.
Properties can also be initialized with default values directly (e.g., name = '';).
Understanding the Constructor:

The constructor is defined using the constructor keyword.
Its primary functions include:
Creating a new object: It sets up a fresh instance of the class.
Binding this: The keyword this refers to the newly created object within the constructor.
Executing Code: It runs any custom initialization logic provided in its body.
Returning the Object: It implicitly returns the newly created object.
Creating and Using Class Instances:

Instances of a class are created using the new keyword followed by the class name.
Example of creating and using a Person instance:
js
Copy code
const giles = new Person("Giles");
giles.introduceSelf(); // Hi! I'm Giles
The new keyword:
Invokes the constructor.
Automatically sets up the new object according to the class definition.
Returns the created object for further use.
Why Use Classes?

Classes provide a clean and organized syntax for defining object blueprints.
They help encapsulate properties and methods, making code more modular and reusable.
The structure mimics classical object-oriented programming, which is familiar to developers from other programming languages.
