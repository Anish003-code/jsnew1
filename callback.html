        Asynchronous programming is a method of coding where tasks can be executed out of the main program flow, allowing multiple operations to run
         concurrently or in the background without waiting for each to complete. 
        This approach enables a program to remain responsive, especially during tasks that might otherwise take time, like network requests 
        or reading large files. e.g set timeout 

        synchronious ==> Synchronous programming is a programming model where tasks are executed sequentially, one at a time, in a blocking manner.
         This means that each operation must complete before the next one begins. In synchronous code, if an operation takes time—like reading
         a large file or making a network request—the entire program pauses and waits for that task to finish before moving on to the next one.
