/*                                        promise channing
Promise chaining is a technique in JavaScript where multiple asynchronous operations are executed in sequence, with each operation depending
 on the result of the previous one. By chaining 
.then() calls, you can create a sequence of tasks where the output of one .then() is passed as input to the next .then().
and below we ahve done the same thing..
