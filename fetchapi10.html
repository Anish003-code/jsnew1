        whenerv we fetch the value then we get a promise, this promise resolve in another promise and the value of this promise is the final 
        result 
        explanation
 we are  using fetch to make an HTTP request to get the weather information. fetch returns a promise that, when resolved, provides a 
 Response object. To access the actual JSON data in the response, you need two .then() methods. Hereâ€™s why:
1. First .then(): When you call fetch, it returns a promise that resolves to a Response object (not the actual data). In the first .then(),
 you get the Response object as value, and you call value.json(), which is a method to parse the response into JSON. value.json() itself 
 returns another promise because parsing the data takes time.
code =>
p.then((value) => {
    return value.json(); // returns a promise
})
Second .then(): Since value.json() returns a promise, you need a second .then() to handle the parsed JSON data when it's ready. The second
 .then() receives the parsed JSON as value1, which is the actual weather data you're looking for. You can then log it or use it as needed.
javascript
Copy code
.then((value1) => {
    console.log(value1); // `value1` is the JSON data
});
So, in summary:
The first .then() handles the response and returns a promise to parse JSON.
The second .then() waits for the JSON parsing to complete and then works with the actual data.
This chaining structure is necessary because fetch involves asynchronous operations at multiple stages (fetching and parsing), 
and each stage returns a promise that you handle sequentially with .then().
parsing JSON means converting a JSON-formatted string into a JavaScript object that you can use in your code.
